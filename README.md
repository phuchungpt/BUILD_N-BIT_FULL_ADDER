Project Overview:
This project involves the design and verification of an N-bit full adder with configurable parameters. The goal is to create a flexible and reusable N-bit full adder by first building a half adder and then connecting multiple full adders together. The full adder is made configurable by using parameterized values, allowing it to support different bit-width configurations (2 to 32 bits).

Features:
Half Adder: The design starts with the creation of a half adder.

Full Adder: Multiple half adders are connected together to form a full adder.

N-bit Full Adder: Full adders are connected to create an N-bit full adder, where N can be configured from 2 to 32 bits.

Parameterized Configuration: The full adder is parameterized to allow for easy configuration of the bit-width (N) during simulation.

Testbench: A single testbench is used to verify the design across different configurations by simply modifying the parameter for N in the testbench.
